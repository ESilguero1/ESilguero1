I’m currently an Electrical and Computer Engineering Honors and Canfield Business Honors student at the University of Texas at Austin, driven by a passion for pushing boundaries in medical technology. As Signals Team Lead at Longhorn Neurotech, I work with two teams to explore how advanced neural interfaces can transform lives.

My interest in this field extends beyond technical innovation—I'm excited about the intersection of engineering and entrepreneurship, seeking opportunities to bring groundbreaking technologies to market. I believe the future of healthcare lies in blending cutting-edge tech with business acumen to create real-world solutions that improve quality of life.

Alongside my academic pursuits, I work as a web developer at Frisco Web agency, where I hone my problem-solving skills by building impactful web solutions for clients. Outside of tech, I’m a musician who finds inspiration in the intricate patterns of music. I love playing guitar and am fascinated by how music connects deeply with people in ways that are both simple and complex. In my free time, I enjoy lifting weights and rock climbing.
